This is a very basic demonstration of a react autocomplete component. It's not meant for production usages as it lacks refinements and tunings.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Future work

- Extract a results box component and result entry component to better organize the code.
- Optimize state mutations & re-renders to increase performance
- Check if we can avoid the usage of state by leveraging stateless componenets
- Use sass instead of css (!)
